# Davidson-Dorn_AquatEcol_2017
Contains data (saved as .txt files - what was I thinking?) and the analysis (spaghetti code) from Davidson and Dorn (2017) in Aquatic Ecology.

E = exotic (Pomacea maculata); N = native (Pomacea paludosa); L = "large" (P. maculata reared to 3-4mm SL); H = "hatchling".

This code is a mess, so please contact me if you are interested in reproducing it, and I will do my best to assist.
